Any statement that starts with a $ indicates things we types at the command prompt. Do not type the "$" :-)


1). First we created a new application using
$ fabmanager create-app

2). We initiated a git repository by
-  creating a repository on github called cms_train
- then initialized the local git repository

$ git init
- Associated the repository with a remote

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/nyimbi/cms_train.git

- Added the initial files to the local repository
$ git add .

- Not necessary by nice to do just to understand where we are
$ git status

- Made the first commit
$ git commit -m "Initial commit of CMS, nothing done yet"

- Pushed our local changes upstream
$  git push -u origin master

- Now we have our local and remote synchronized
# https://github.com/nyimbi/cms_train


3). Create a temp database for the schema
-  since we did not create a database for the user "shared" nor give them access to PostgreSQL, we need to do so. This is only done once in the lifetime of a machine or server

-  Change role to superuser
$ sudo -s

- login as the postgres user (masquerading)
$ su  - postgres
# note the space after the -

$ createuser shared
$ createdb shared
-  so that the user has their own database, should they need it ever

$psql 
- login to the PostgreSQL server as user postgres (who has super powers)
$$ alter user shared with password '....' createdb;

- $$ means to type in psql
- Look at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-alteruser.html for the syntax of the ALTER USER command
-  I put ... for the password because this will eventually be on github and publicly available. NEVER WRITE PASSWORDS, KEYS in to a file that you manage with git
